when creating a thread u apply a function
pthread_create : to create a thread
pthread_join : makes the application waits for a thread to end
a process can handle multiple threads
threads shares memory the opposite of processes who duplicate the variables and each process work on his own space of memory

RACE CONDITIONS !! (occure only on multi core processor)
Race conditions in software or any system occur when the desired output requires that certain events occur in a specific order,
but that the events don’t always happen in that order.
There is a ‘race’ between the events and if the wrong events win, the program fails.


MUTEX !!
synchronization is a mecanism which ensures that 2 or more processes or threads do not execute simultaneaosly some particular program segment.
in case of not applying a synch technique as mutex a race conditions may occure.

Mutex is a lock thats set to protect shared resources, its kind of a lock who block the thread to execute a part of code
until the thread who owns the locks is finished executing.
