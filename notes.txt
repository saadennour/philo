RACE CONDITIONS !! (occure only on multi core processor)
Race conditions in software or any system occur when the desired output requires that certain events occur in a specific order,
but that the events don’t always happen in that order.
There is a ‘race’ between the events and if the wrong events win, the program fails.


MUTEX !!
Mutex is a lock thats set to protect shared resources, its kind of a lock who block the thread to execute a part of code
until the thread who owns the locks is finished executing.
